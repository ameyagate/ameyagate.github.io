## Data Science

### [Project 1: Credit-Risk-Modeling-in-Python](https://github.com/ameyagate/Credit-Risk-Modeling-in-Python/blob/main/Credit%20Risk%20Modeling.ipynb)
* Developed predictive model to identify credit risk, performed data transformation (one-hot encoding, min-max normalization) and exploratory data analysis (EDA), resulting in 94% accuracy score
* Implemented 6 machine learning algorithms : K-means Clustering, Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Classifier in Python

### [Project 2: Netflix Movie Recommendation Tool in Python](https://github.com/ameyagate/ameyagate.github.io/blob/476fe1144e908bcadc2f9d5773a21cc095997169/Netflix%20Movie%20Suggestions.ipynb)
* Performed market-basket analysis on Netflix dataset to derive rules using Apriori algorithm and to recommend relevant movies to the customers
* Computed association between the movies based on the watch history using support, confidence, lift, leverage and Zhang's metrics 

### [Project 3: Analyzing Customer Churn in Power BI](https://github.com/ameyagate/PowerBI/blob/main/Dashboard%20for%20Customer%20Churn%20in%20Telecom%20Industry.pdf)
* Created user-friendly dashboard and visualized metrics to identify reasons leading to customer churn using Power BI
* Computed new measures using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to capture correlation between variables leading to churn

### [Project 4: Price Prediction Tool in Python](https://github.com/ameyagate/ameyagate.github.io/blob/658c0a6f04283101eeedd55cee316b8e5ed276b0/Price%20predictions%20for%20used%20cars.ipynb)
* Built data science model to predict the price of pre-owned cars for dataset of 50000+ line items in Python
* Identified high impact variables and implemented 2 machine learning models: Random Forest and Linear Regression

### Project 5: Report Automation Tool in Python
* Automated data gathering, cleaning and reporting for dataset of 400,000+ line items in Python
* Computed Demand Vs Supply rates (fill rates) for 1000+ SKUs and exported it into spreadsheet format
